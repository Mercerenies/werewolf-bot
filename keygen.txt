== COMMANDS TO GENERATE THE RSA KEYS ==
=======================================

I'm only putting this here for my convenience. This file is for
informational purposes only and is not actually used by the software
in any way.

Generate the .pem file for the private key:
    openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

Generate the corresponding public key file:
    openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

Convert private key to .der (Java doesn't support .pem):
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in private.pem -outform DER -nocrypt -out private.der
